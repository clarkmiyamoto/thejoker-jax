## Yifan
- For benchmarking Gaussian, compare mean, variance, and integral .
- Implement `NUTs` in `sampler_numpy`
- Implement `NUTs` in `sampler_jax`

## Hogg
- Implement data: "The velocity you want to use is V_HELIO (although it is *actually* V_BARY), and the associated error."
- Can you plot maybe 40 stars (radial velocity vs. time; data is always black; I want error bars) and I will choose a few of them to be our poster children. Can you also look to see which stars were the poster children in The Joker papers?
- Implement sampling from posterior function in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.07602
